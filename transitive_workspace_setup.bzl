    # Below the interface boundary:
    # This is needed to get transitive dependencies of transitive dependencies--by calling their deps functions.

    # Why?
    # Bazel doesn't let you call a load except at the top level after v3 or so :/, so you have to resort to calling waves of workspace functions, one per each additional layer of transitive dependencies.
